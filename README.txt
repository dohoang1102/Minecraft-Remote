What is it?
	Minecraft Remote is an easy to use GUI for your Minecraft server. This can either be used as is, or be edited to your liking. The code is fairly simple and written in applescript/cocoa.

How dose it work?
	It works by simply opening a terminal window and automatically typing in commands when you press a button.

Set Up:
	The code is very easy to modify. Simply open up the Xcode project, go to the AppDelegate.applescript file and put in your local or server information under the Connect Section.

Installation:
	Theres really not much to it, simply change the code to go to your server/directory, and click "Run" and it should compile fine.
